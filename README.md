Teaching some basics of web development

Simple placeholder website with which to get started teaching.

## Development

Currently just static HTML, CSS, and JS to begin demonstrating some basic web development principles to locals.

All development should be done on separate branches off the `main` branch and squash merged back into `main` when complete, which will trigger a deployment.

## Hosting

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4cd1fd97-6c7c-4acf-be07-91beaebb6e9f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mellifluous-pixie-9fa8fa/deploys)

Currently the `main` branch is hosted with Netlify and using their asset optimization post-processing (minifies html, css, and js).
